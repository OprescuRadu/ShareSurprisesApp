# ShareSurprisesApp
OOP application.

Following the OOP principles this app is meant to manage a set of surprises. 

The system can generate multiple types of surprises (currently three), that can be put in different types of bags (also three), each with its own characteristics.
The type of container can be chosen whether it is intended to optimise storage or access. You have the possibility to fulfill the joy of giving in three ways.
